# PlanTech
AN IOT-BASED SMART POT FOR PECHAY WITH ANDROID APP FOR MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

## What is it?
PlanTech was assembled using the main components such as Arduino
Uno as the microcontroller, NodeMCU, connected with sensors such as soil moisture,
water level and photoresistor light sensor. 

The system comes with an android application to monitor the important parameters affecting the growth of pechay such as
soil moisture, sunlight and water pH level and the actuators connected to the system.
