AN IOT-BASED SMART POT FOR PECHAY WITH ANDROID APP FOR MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

## What is it?
PlanTech: An IoT-based Smart Pot for Pechay with Android App for Monitoring
Environmental Factors presents an automated smart pot based on the Internet of Things
(IoT). The system provides a smart means of caring and monitoring the growth of
pechay through the use of automation and IoT technology and to replace conventional
systems where the pechay is watered manually by humans. The system is developed to
grow pechay and be able to provide optimal yields using the smart pot.

- PlanTech was assembled using the main components such as Arduino
Uno as the microcontroller, NodeMCU, connected with sensors such as soil moisture,
water level and photoresistor light sensor. It is also designed with an integrated tank that supplies the desired amount of
water. It also has artificial lighting as an alternative source of light i.e., when plants are
placed indoors.

- The system comes with an android application to monitor the important parameters affecting the growth of pechay such as
soil moisture, sunlight and water pH level and the actuators connected to the system.
